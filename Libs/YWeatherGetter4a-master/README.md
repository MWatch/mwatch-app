An Yahoo Weather API wrapper for android

An iOS version can be found here.
https://github.com/zh-wang/YWeatherGetter4i

It is a [library project](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html).  
This repo also contains a sample project in /library_project.  
Yahoo Weather API wrapper works on android 1.6 or above.  
Sample app can be found on Google Play.

+  What is this?

  This is a wrapper for getting weather information from Yahoo Weather RSS Feed.  
  You can find its guideline here.  [Yahoo Weather RSS Feed](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/).  
  Note that, if you want to use weather API for commercial purpose, you should contact Yahoo first.  

+ How do I use it?

   * First, implement YahooWeatherInfoListener in your Activity. Overwrite the callback function "gotWeatherInfo", which will be called after querying from Yahoo weather API. And, you need `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` to use `YWeatherGetter4a`.

    ```java
    @Override
    public void gotWeatherInfo(WeatherInfo weatherInfo) {
        if(weatherInfo != null) {
            // Add your code here
            // weatherInfo object contains all information returned by Yahoo Weather apis
        }
    }
    ```

  * Second, use following code to assign the location where you want to get weather information at. Or you can input the location in app's top search bar.
    `YahooWeather` class provides 3 methods to query Yahoo's Weather apis.
      1. Query by place's name. You can replace `cityAreaOrLocation` to what you want. For example, "Tokyo Japan", "Acara√π Brazil", "Shanghai China", etc.  
      ```java
      public void queryYahooWeatherByPlaceName(final Context context, final String cityAreaOrLocation, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result) 
      ```

      2. Query by latitude and longitude
      ```java
      public void queryYahooWeatherByLatLon(final Context context, final String lat, final String lon, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result) 
      ```

      3. Use device's gps to detect current location. Then do the query. Remeber, you need ` ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION ` or ` ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION ` to use this.  
      ```java
      public void queryYahooWeatherByGPS(final Context context, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result) 
      ```

      4. You can set connect timeout and socket timeout by `setConnectTimeout` and `setSocketTimeout`. Or get the instance by `getInstance(int connectTimeout, int socketTimeout)`.

      5. Handle exception by using `setExceptionListener`.

  * If you use GPS position for query, the result `WeatherInfo` will contains an `Address` object, which is the detail address object return from `Geocoder`. It contains a lot of information but this lib only use `locality`, `adminArea`, and `countryName` by default. See `YahooWeather.addressToPlaceName` and [Geocoder](http://developer.android.com/intl/ja/reference/android/location/Address.html) for details.

+ What kind of weather information can I get?
  You can get
  * current condition of weather, humidity, wind, etc.
  * forecast information for next four days.
