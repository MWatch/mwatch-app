Need to undergo some restructuring off this app, leaks and crashes everywhere.

Todo:
    - Condense the bt services into one service
    - Condense to one activity eventually
    - bind single service to the single activity
    - handle all unbinding and un registering of all listeners, Broadcast receivers and services.
    - un clearable notification that live updates with how long the device has been connected
    - filters check box
    - settings page
    - override onPause and onResume Activity methods to make sure it says the current state of connection on resume


Bug List:
    - [Major] Crash after disconnecting and trying to reconnect
    - [Major] Crash when turning on bluetooth [FIXED]
    - [Minor] No way of disconnecting on the phone currently
