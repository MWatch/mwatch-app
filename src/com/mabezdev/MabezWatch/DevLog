Bug List:
    - Clicking on the notification will cancel the connection when opening the app,
      this could be due to the onResume and onPause methods not being overridden
    - sometimes the weather stops being sent after multiple connect/disconnects
    - sometimes the notification push service stops being sent after multiple connect/disconnects
    - facebook message are not being sent atm
